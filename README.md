# 🏠 Nigeria Real Estate Price Prediction

This project is focused on predicting real estate prices in Nigeria using machine learning. The dataset contains housing features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, toilets, parking spaces, and geographical location (state and town), along with the house title (e.g., Detached Duplex, Block of Flats).

The aim is to develop a regression model that accurately estimates house prices and provides insights into real estate pricing patterns in Nigeria.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset, `nigeria_houses_data.csv`, includes **24,326** Nigerian housing records with the following features:

- **Numerical**: `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `toilets`, `parking_space`, `price`
- **Categorical**: `title`, `town`, `state`

New engineered features include:
- `bed_bath_ratio`: Ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms
- `bath_toilet_ratio`: Ratio of bathrooms to toilets
- `room_total`: Total of rooms (bedrooms + bathrooms + toilets)
- `parking_per_room`: Parking space normalized by total room count

## 🧠 Model

The model used is an **XGBoost Regressor**, trained on 24,000 data points.

### 🔧 Model Parameters

- **Objective**: `reg:squarederror`
- **Estimators**: 100
- **Learning Rate**: 0.1
- **Max Depth**: 6
- **Random State**: 42

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

On the **validation dataset**:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: `0.389`
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: `0.343`
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: `0.586`
- **R² Score**: `0.688`

On the **unseen test data**:

- **R² Score**: `0.709`

---

## 🛠 Preprocessing Steps

1. **Feature Engineering** – new columns were created from existing numerical features.
2. **Encoding** – categorical features were transformed using one-hot encoding.
3. **Normalization** – prices were log-transformed (`log_price`) to reduce skewness.
4. **Data Splitting** – 24,000 records used for training; remaining used for evaluation.

---

## 🔍 Insights

- The model performs well on unseen data with an R² score above 0.70, suggesting strong predictive power.
- Engineering domain-specific ratios like `bed_bath_ratio` and `parking_per_room` added value to the prediction quality.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` or `Optuna`.
- Testing other models like `LightGBM`, `CatBoost`, or deep learning.
- Incorporating external economic indicators (e.g., inflation, location demand).
- Deploying the model via Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
